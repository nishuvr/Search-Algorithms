# Search-Algorithms
Search Algorithms aim at navigating from a start state to a goal state by transitioning through
intermediate states. It also consists of a state space which is a set of all possible states where
you can be.
There are many informed and uninformed search algorithms that exist and are very popular.
A* search, Uniform Cost search (UCS), Depth First Search (DFS), Greedy Search to name a
few.
I implemented a function called tri_traversal which implements three main search
algorithms - A* search, Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Depth First Search (DFS) 

To run the code - 
run python sample_test_case.py
